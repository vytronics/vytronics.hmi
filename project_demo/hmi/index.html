Default SCADA desktop HTML file. This file should not normally be used. It is
only provided to make a working system from a default install. It loads a default home
display that shows project tags in the project.json file in a tabular format.

A typical SCADA HMI will have a single desktop
with one or more iframe for loading HMI displays. This default has just one iframe
of a fixed size but you could, in javascript document ready processing resize the
iframe, set to full screen, etc.

You can use this file as a starting point for the index.html in your project folder.
The default location is in ./project in the root folder. Use VYTRONICS_PROJDIR
environment to tell the server where to find your folder if using a different location.

	libraries are made available to any content loaded into HMI iframes and is used as well
	for the general pluming implementing the web-based HMI.

	HMI iframe. The loaded home page should have navigation buttons if more than one
	display is defined as well as those loaded displays should. Optionally this desktop HTML
	can also have navigation buttons/functions that load specific content into a destination
	iframe.
    
Instrumented html and SVG files can be loaded into the iframe by setting the src attribute.

    <!-- place where SCADA displays will get loaded. Does not need an id but that would be
		useful for any navigation functions you wanted to add to the desktop html.
		When loading/loaded, vy-client scripts will make jquery "$" function and vytronics "vy"
		object available in the iframe global scope. Loaded SVG, and any of its included
		widgets can also download external javascript using vy-loadscript(url) function. So,
		say you wanted to share some HMI logic across multiple SVG displays, then simply call
		vy-loadscript(url) in the page script.
		
		SVG files have instrumentation directives in the "http://www.vytronics.com/hmi"
		namespace to link elements to tags etc. These directives are parsed on load to
		create the real-time dynamics.
